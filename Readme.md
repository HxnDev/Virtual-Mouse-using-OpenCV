# Virtual Mouse Using OpenCV
In this project we will be using the live feed coming from the webcam to create a virtual mouse.

## Requirements:
Following modules need to be installed for it to work properly:
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Autopy

### OpenCV:
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.

It can be installed using "pip install opencv-python"


### Mediapipe:
MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal (eg. video, audio, any time series data), cross platform (i.e Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines.

It can be installed using "pip install mediapipe"

### Autopy:
AutoPy is a simple, cross-platform GUI automation library for Python. It includes functions for controlling the keyboard and mouse, finding colors and bitmaps on-screen, and displaying alerts.

It can be installed using "pip install autopy"
